This is a small project created as part of my learning journey in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates some simple, practical innovations and features I implemented to strengthen my skills.
Feel free to explore the code, use it, or adapt it for your own projects. If you'd like the source code, you can find it here in this repository.
